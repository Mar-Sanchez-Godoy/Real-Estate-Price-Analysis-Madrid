## Conclusions

### Why Are Prices Increasing?

The analysis suggests that the long-term increase in Madrid's housing prices is primarily related to the interaction between growing demand and relatively limited housing supply. However, housing prices are also influenced by broader economic and financial conditions that affect households' purchasing capacity, access to credit, and investment decisions.

Several structural and macroeconomic factors may help explain the evolution of the market:

* **Growing demand:** Madrid continues to attract population, employment, and economic activity, increasing demand for housing.

* **Limited housing supply:** New housing construction has not always kept pace with demand, creating persistent upward pressure on prices.

* **Limited availability of land:** The availability and development of suitable land constrain the ability to increase housing supply quickly, particularly in areas with strong demand.

* **Lower interest rates:** The reduction in European interest rates has improved financing conditions compared with the high-rate environment of 2023–2024. The ECB's main refinancing rate fell from 4.25% in June 2024 to 2.40% in June 2026, reducing the cost of bank funding and supporting a gradual improvement in financing conditions.

* **Improved economic conditions:** Following the severe contraction of the Spanish economy in 2020, economic activity recovered strongly. Spain's GDP grew by 5.5% in 2021 and, following subsequent statistical revisions, 6.2% in 2022. A stronger economic environment can support housing demand by improving employment, household income expectations, and consumer confidence.

* **Lower unemployment:** Spain's unemployment rate declined from 15.53% in 2020 to 12.92% in 2022, indicating a significant improvement in labour-market conditions during the recovery period.

* **Improved access to mortgage financing:** As financing conditions improve, more households may regain access to mortgage credit or become willing to enter the housing market. This can increase effective demand, particularly when combined with relatively limited housing supply.

* **Construction costs:** Higher construction and material costs can increase the final cost of new housing and reduce the speed at which new supply can enter the market.

* **Economic concentration:** Madrid's position as a major economic and employment centre increases its attractiveness to workers, businesses, and investors, supporting sustained housing demand.

* **Investment demand:** Housing can also attract investors seeking long-term returns, adding another source of demand, particularly in areas with strong rental markets and expectations of capital appreciation.


These factors should not be interpreted as individual causes derived directly from the dataset. The project identifies historical price patterns, while the broader economic interpretation is supported by external research and macroeconomic indicators from institutions such as the Banco de España, the ECB, and the INE.


However, this projection should be treated as a **scenario based on historical trends, rather than a definitive price forecast**. A more robust forecasting model would require additional variables such as interest rates, population growth, income, construction activity, mortgage lending, and employment.

This represents an opportunity for further analysis and model development.
